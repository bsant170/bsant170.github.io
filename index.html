        <h2>Salvation Story:</h2>
        
         <p> I grew up my entire life in a Christian home where I was taught at a very early age Biblical principles and sat under Godly 
             preaching. Through my elementary years, I would occasionally make a profession of faith mainly because I was afraid of spending 
             eternity in hell, but not really because I wanted a relationship with my Heavenly Father. </p>
             
         <p> When I entered the youth group in 7th grade, I had a lot of doubt if I was truly born again. There were many "red flags" in my 
            life that I was noticing making me aware of my spiritual condition. I was craving desires that were not Christ-like, and giving 
            in to my sinful temptations on a regular basis instead of asking the Holy Spirit for help. But I also was acting like a hypocrite. 
            All my friends and authorities assumed I was saved which convinced me that I wasn't really that bad. For example, on one Sunday 
            after the SS lesson my teacher referenced me as a brother in Christ and normally someone wouldn't think anything of it. But I 
            think it was the Holy Spirit that was convicting me of my sin. Finally our Pastor kept urging the congregation to turn to Christ 
            and make our salvation sure. At that point, I knew it couldn't go on any longer. So the following Monday morning (January 12, 2019)
            I genuinely came to know my Savior and be His child forever. </p>

        <p> I got baptized 3 years later and joined our church a few months after that. That summer, I surrendered to full-time Christian service 
            and I'm excited to see what the Lord has for me as I keep following Him.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy listening to podcasts and having deep conversations.
