        <h2>Salvation Story:</h2>
        
         <p> I grew up my entire life in a Christian home where I was taught at a very early age Biblical principles and sat under Godly 
             preaching. Through my elementary years, I would occasionally make a profession of faith mainly because I was afraid of spending 
             eternity in hell, but not really because I wanted a relationship with my Heavenly Father. </p>
             
         <p> When I entered the youth group in 7th grade, I had a lot of doubt if I was truly born again. There were many "red flags" in my 
            life that I was noticing making me aware of my spiritual condition. I was craving desires that were not Christ-like, and giving 
            in to my sinful temptations on a regular basis instead of asking the Holy Spirit for help. But I also was acting like a hypocrite. 
            All my friends and authorities assumed I was saved which convinced me that I wasn't really that bad. For example, on one Sunday 
            after the SS lesson my teacher referenced me as a brother in Christ and normally someone wouldn't think anything of it. But I 
            think it was the Holy Spirit that was convicting me of my sin. Finally our Pastor kept urging the congregation to turn to Christ 
            and make our salvation sure. At that point, I knew it couldn't go on any longer. So the following Monday morning (January 12, 2019)
            I genuinely came to know my Savior and be His child forever. </p>

        <p> I got baptized 3 years later and joined our church a few months after that. That summer, I surrendered to full-time Christian service 
            and I'm excited to see what the Lord has for me as I keep following Him.
        </p> 
        
        <h3>A little about myself:</h3>

        <p> music: I have been playing piano for about 10 years and love performing classical pieces as well as ministering sacred arrangements at 
            my church. I also enjoy composing piano solos and collaborating on arranging new tunes to familiar hymns with some of my friends. 
        
        <p> sports: Being half-Canadian I particularly enjoy watching NHL <a href="https://www.nhl.com/">here</a> and CFL (Canadian Football League) 
            <a href="https://www.cfl.ca/">here</a> but also enjoy playing some pickup soccer with a group of guys from church. 
      
        <p> family: I am the oldest of 2 siblings. I have a younger sister who is 15 and then a younger brother who is 12. Both my parent's family's 
            moved from the Philipines before they were born. My dad grew up in Canada his whole life and my mom was raised in California when they 
            eventually met at BJU. 

        <p> personal: I'm 17 and planning to graduate from high school in May. I have had the privilege of being homeschooled my entire life. Right 
            now, I feel the Lord has called me to major in Bible. So I'm planning on attending BJU in the Fall with an emphasis on Biblial Studies 
            with the hopes of being able to be involved in some type of ministry (whether that's being an assitant/youth pastor, camp ministry, missions, 
            or champlaincy).
